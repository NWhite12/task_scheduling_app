## Requirements
The following are a list of technology's and knowledge that will be referenced during the development of this software. 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
    - The programming language that handles the logic of the app
- [jdk 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
    - The run time environment that executes the app. **Note:** jdk 8 is needed because of the tornado fx library needing of java FX which supports jdk 8.
- [TornadoFX](https://tornadofx.io/)
    - The GUI library in which the GUI is made from
- [hibernate](https://hibernate.org/)
    - A tool that map's our java class models into models for the DBMS
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
    - The Tool that builds the app and makes sure all the dependence's are there. 
- [PG admin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
    - This allows you to view the database outside of the app to make sure data is save/read correctly. 

## Installation

### Recommendations
We suggest using the windows 10 environment to run/ build this app. We also suggest using the [Intellij IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), as it makes dealing with the multiple technologies much easer. 

**Note:** The app has not been tested on older versions of windows or any Unix based system. So we do not grantee it will work.
